Chandroid [Working Title]
============

Android application to interact with all of 4Chan.

This application uses the 4Chan API to retrieve JSON information on the various elements of 4Chan.
It will then display that data to the user.

This application is not yet fully featured, and is a larger side project of mine.
The development of this app may go slowly, but I intend for it to eventually compete with the 4Chan apps currently on the play store.

I will never close the source code of this application to the public, meaning this app will remain open source forever.

When I feel as though the application has its main features at a relatively stable point, I will release
an Alpha version of the application on the Google Play Store.

If you do not use the Google Play Store, and would like a direct .apk, e-mail me about it and I will send it to you
at my earliest convenience. (I may host the .apk somewhere when the app is Alpha ready)

If you would like to contact me, send me an e-mail at: waaronl@okstate.edu
